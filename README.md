# HTTP/1.1 Backend Framework (Demo)

This repository contains a **learning-oriented demo project** built in Python.  
The goal is to explore backend fundamentals such as request handling, middleware, and observability, without relying on third-party web frameworks.

It is **not a production framework**, but rather a sandbox to practice backend development concepts and financial API integration.

## Tech Stack
- Python (standard library only)
-

## Concepts Covered
- Basic HTTP/1.1 request parsing and routing  
- Middleware chains for pre/post request processing

## Focus
This project is meant to:  
- Illustrate **backend fundamentals** for learners  
- Show how **observability and security concepts** can be integrated into small projects  
- Demonstrate interest in **financial systems and regtech**
