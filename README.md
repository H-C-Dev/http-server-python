# HTTP/1.1 Backend Demo Project

This repository contains a small Python demo project designed for learning backend fundamentals.  
It is a sandbox to experiment with request handling, simple routing, and security basics — without using third-party web frameworks.  

⚠️ This project is **educational only** and not intended for production use.

## Tech Stack
- Python (standard library only)

---

## Concepts Covered
- Basic HTTP/1.1 request parsing and routing  
- Request/response hooks for flexible processing  
- Simple logging and request identifiers  
- Basic timing measurements for performance awareness  
- Cross-origin request handling  
- Basic session support

## Example Project: Financial API Integration
To demonstrate practical use, the demo includes a small full-stack example:

- **Frontend:** Next.js dashboard  
- **Integration:** external financial API (e.g. account balance fetch)

## Focus
This demo is meant to:
- Illustrate backend fundamentals for learners  
- Show how simple logging and security considerations can be layered into a small project  
- Demonstrate curiosity about financial systems and regulatory technology
